It's always polite to share. And after years of using Github for contributions to private repositories, I figured it was time for a change. This is where I toss quick little JavaScript functions that at least made my life just a little bit easier; maybe they'll do the same for you.

### Getting started
Grab a function and use it.

### Really?
Really.

### Will you formalize this into a proper library at some point?
If it gets to a point where I think that's necessary, sure. Sometimes all you need is a nice, simple function.

### Why do some of these have clever names?
I take my little bits of amusement in life where I can get them.

### So hey... This is cool, but some of these could use some performance tweaks!
Absolutely! Right now I'm just cleaning out the closet, a new branch will follow where polishing will be done as-needed.

### List of functions
* Clone Counter - Read an array of numbers, pick out the one that appears most frequently
* Dottie - Clip a string to an arbitrary length and append an ellipsis after the last whole word
* Measure - Return the width and height of an arbitary HTML element as both raw numbers and CSS-friendly strings
* Swapper - Scan the text in the DOM for a particular regex pattern and replace it with something else
