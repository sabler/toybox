It's always polite to share. And after years of using Github for contributions to private repositories, I figured it was time for a change. This is where I'm tossing little JavaScript functions I've written that at least made my life a little bit easier. Maybe they'll do the same for you.

### Getting started
Grab a function and use it.

### Really?
Really.

### Will you formalize this into a proper library at some point?
If it gets to a point where I think that's necessary, sure. But sometimes all you need in life is a quick function tossed into your bigger project, so I'm focusing on that right now.

### Why do some of these have clever names?
I take my little bits of amusement in life where I can get them.

### So hey... This is cool, but some of these could use some performance tweaks!
Absolutely! Right now I'm just cleaning out the closet, a new branch will follow where polishing will be done as-needed. If you see something that's really bugging you, though, you're also free to just jump in. :)

### List of functions
* Clone Counter - Read an array of numbers, pick out the one that appears most frequently
* Dottie - Clip a string to an arbitrary length and append an ellipsis after the last whole word
* Measure - Return the width and height of an arbitary HTML element as both raw numbers and CSS-friendly strings
* Param Peek - Return the value of a key/value pair that exists in the URL
* Scroll Track - Approxmiate the user's scroll position on the page in percentages, also delivers scroll direction
* Swapper - Scan the text in the DOM for a particular regex pattern and replace it with something else
